Hi! My name is **Jordi Smit**. I'm deeply passionate about software engineering, data science, and automation.
Nothing makes me happier than creating software that helps humans by automating a tedious and manual-intensive part of their job.
Therefore, I love talking about data science since this field has opened the door to many new kinds of automations.
However, too often, data science solutions stay stuck at the proof of concept level.
To combat this issue, you also need software engineering knowledge.
That is why I love the intersection between software engineering, data science, and automation.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/) in Amsterdam.
Here I help companies to transform their ML-based models into production-ready applications.
I love this job because it allows me to explore the intersection between software engineering and data science daily.

Furthermore, for me, nothing is more satisfying than creating new things with the latest technologies.
I also believe that the best way to test if you understand these technologies is to teach them.
Therefore, this website aims to share my experience with these technologies in the hope it might help someone in the future.
If this website has helped you anyway, feel free to contact me on any of my socials!
